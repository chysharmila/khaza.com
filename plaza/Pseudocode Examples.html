<h1><center>Pseudocode Examples</center></h1>

<p>

<b>An <u>algorithm</u> is a procedure for solving a problem in terms of the actions to be executed
and the order in which those actions are to be executed.  An algorithm is merely the
sequence of steps taken to solve a problem.  The steps are normally "sequence,"   
"selection, " "iteration," and a case-type statement.  </b></p><p><b>

</b></p><p><b>

In C, "sequence statements" are imperatives.  The "selection" is the "if then else"
statement, and the iteration is satisfied by a number of statements, such as the "while," "
do," and the "for,"  while the case-type statement is satisfied by the "switch" statement.</b></p><p><b>

</b></p><hr><b>
</b><p><b>

<u>Pseudocode</u> is an artificial and informal language that helps programmers develop
algorithms.  Pseudocode is a "text-based" detail (algorithmic) design tool.</b></p><p>

</p><p>

<b>The rules of Pseudocode are reasonably straightforward.  All statements showing
"dependency" are to be indented.  These include while, do, for, if, switch.  Examples below
will illustrate this notion.</b></p><p><b>

Examples:</p><p>

</p><p>

1..  If student's grade is greater than or equal to 60</p><p>

</p><ul>           Print "passed"<p> </p></ul>

      else<p>

</p><ul>           Print "failed"  </ul><p>
</p><hr>
<p></p><p></p><p>

2.    Set total to zero</p><p>

       Set grade counter to one</p><p>

       While grade counter is less than or equal to ten</p><p>

</p><ul>            Input the next grade</ul><p>

</p><ul>            Add the grade into the total  </ul><p>

       Set the class average to the total divided by ten</p><p>

       Print the class average.</p><p>
</p><hr>
<p></p><p></p><p>

3.  </p><p>

     Initialize total to zero</p><p>

     Initialize counter to zero</p><p>

     Input the first grade</p><p>

     while the user has not as yet entered the sentinel</p><p>

         </p><ul> add this grade into the running total </ul><p>

	</p><ul> add one to the grade counter  </ul><p>

</p><ul>          input the next grade (possibly the sentinel)</ul><p>

     if the counter is not equal to zero</p><p>

    </p><ul>      set the average to the total divided by the counter</ul><p>

        </p><ul>  print the average  </ul><p>

     else</p><p>

</p><ul>          print 'no grades were entered' </ul><p>
</p><hr>
<p></p><p></p><p>

4.  </p><p>

initialize passes to zero</p><p>

initialize failures to zero</p><p>

initialize student to one</p><p>

while student counter is less than or equal to ten</p><p>

     </p><ul>input the next exam result  </ul><p>

     </p><ul>if the student passed<p>

         </p><ul> add one to passes </ul><p>

     else</p><p>

         </p><ul> add one to failures  </ul></ul><p>

     add one to student counter </p><p>

print the number of passes</p><p>

print the number of failures</p><p>

if eight or more students passed</p><p>

</p><ul>     print "raise tuition"</ul><p>

<center> <b> <h3> Some Keywords That Should be Used </h3></b><br></center>

For looping and selection, The keywords that are to be used include Do
While...EndDo;  Do Until...Enddo;  Case...EndCase;  If...Endif;  Call ...
with (parameters); Call;  Return ....;  Return;  When;  Always use scope
terminators for loops and iteration. <p>

As verbs, use the words Generate, Compute, Process, etc.  Words such as
set, reset, increment, compute, calculate, add, sum, multiply, ... print,
display, input, output, edit, test , etc. with careful indentation tend to
foster desirable pseudocode.  </p><p>

Do not include data declarations in your pseudocode.</p><p>
